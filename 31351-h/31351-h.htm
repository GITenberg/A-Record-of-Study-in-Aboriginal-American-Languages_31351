<h2 class="chapterhead">PREFATORY.</h2>


<p>If this review of my own work in the field of American Linguistics
requires an apology, I may say that the preparation of it was suggested
to me by my late friend, Mr. James Constantine Pilling, whose admirable
volumes on the bibliography of American Aboriginal Languages are
familiar to all students. He had experienced the difficulty of
cataloguing the articles of writers whose contributions extend over many
years, and have been published in different journals, proceedings of
societies and volumes, and was impressed with the advantage of an
analytical list composed by the author himself.</p>

<p>With this in view, I have arranged the present survey of my writings in
this branch of science, extending over a period of two score years. They
are grouped geographically, and sufficient reference to their contents
subjoined to indicate their aims and conclusions.</p>

</div>

<p>The earlier numbers, (<a href="#ref1">1-4</a>,) in the above list are occupied with the
inquiry whether the native American languages, as a group, have peculiar
morphological traits, which justify their classification as one of the
great divisions of human speech. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> question, I have been a
disciple of Wilhelm von Humboldt and Professor H. Steinthal, and have
argued that the phenomenon of Incorporation, in some of its forms, is
markedly present in the vast majority, if not in all, American tongues.
That which has been called “polysynthesis” is one of these forms. This
is nothing more than a familiar, nigh universal, grammatic process
carried to an extreme degree. It is the <i>dvanda</i> of the Sanscrit
grammarians, an excellent study of which has recently appeared from the
pen of Dr. H. C. Müller.<a name="FNanchor_6-1_1" id="FNanchor_6-1_1" href="#Footnote_6-1_1" class="fnanchor">6-1</a> In its higher forms Incorporation
subordinates the nominal concepts of the phrase to those of time and
relation, which are essentially verbal, and this often where the true
verbal concept, that of abstract action, is lacking, and the verb itself
is in reality a noun in the possessive relation.<a name="corr1" id="corr1"></a><ins class="correction" title="This footnote marker was missing in the original"><a name="FNanchor_6-2_2" id="FNanchor_6-2_2" href="#Footnote_6-2_2" class="fnanchor">6-2</a></ins></p>

<p>Even extremely simple American languages, such as the Zoque, display the
tendency to energetic synthesis;<a name="FNanchor_6-3_3" id="FNanchor_6-3_3" href="#Footnote_6-3_3" class="fnanchor">6-3</a> while many of them carry the
incorporative quality to such a degree that the sentence becomes one
word, a good example of which is the Micmac.<a name="FNanchor_6-4_4" id="FNanchor_6-4_4" href="#Footnote_6-4_4" class="fnanchor">6-4</a> Some American and
French writers have misunderstood the nature of this trait, and have
denied it; but the student who acquaints himself thoroughly with the
authors above mentioned, will not be misled.<a name="FNanchor_6-5_5" id="FNanchor_6-5_5" href="#Footnote_6-5_5" class="fnanchor">6-5</a></p>

<p>The MS. of the Memoir by W. von Humboldt I obtained from the Berlin
Library. Even Professor Steinthal, in his edition of Humboldt’s
linguistic Works, had overlooked it. It is a highly philosophic analysis
of the verb, as it occurs in the languages of the following tribes:
Abipones, Achaguas, Betoyas, Caribs, Huastecas, Lules, Maipures, Mayas,
Mbayas, Mexicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> (Nahuas), Mixtecas, Mocovis, Omaguas, Otomis,
Tamanacas, Totonacos, Tupis, Yaruros.</p>

<p>In (<a href="#ref5">5</a>) I have examined the various alleged affiliations between American
and Asiatic tongues, and showed they are wholly unfounded.</p>

<p>In (<a href="#ref7">7</a>) I have entered a plea for more attention to American languages.
Not only for ethnographic purposes are they useful, but their primitive
aspects and methods of presenting ideas enable us to solve psychological
and grammatic problems more completely than other tongues.</p>

<p>In support of this, in (<a href="#ref9">9</a>) and (<a href="#ref10">10</a>), I endeavor to outline what must
have been the morphology of the language which man spoke when in the
very beginning of his existence as man; a speech of marvelous
simplicity, but adapted to his wants.</p>

<p>The volume, of nearly four hundred pages, entitled <i>The American Race</i>
(No. <a href="#ref11">11</a>) was the first attempt at a systematic classification of all the
tribes of America, North, Central and South, on the basis of language.
It defines seventy-nine linguistic stocks in North America and sixty-one
in South America. The number of tribes named and referred to these
stocks is nearly sixteen hundred. Several of these stocks are defined
for the first time, such as the Tequistlatecan of Mexico, the Matagalpan
of Central America, and in South America the Timote, the Paniquita, the
Cocanuca, the Mocoa, the Betoya, the Lamuca, etc.</p>

<p>In the article (<a href="#ref8">8</a>) I show that, contrary to an oft expressed opinion,
the rate of change in these unwritten tongues is remarkably slow, not
greater than in cultivated languages.</p>

<p>When the publishers of the <i>Standard Dictionary</i> (New York, 1895) were
preparing that well-known work, they placed in my hands all the words in
the English language derived from the native tongues of America.
Although the etymology of some of them remains obscure, I believe the
derivation of all positively traced will be found presented.</p>

<p>I early became convinced that the translations of books of devotion,
etc., into the native tongues gave no correct impression of those
tongues. The ideas conveyed were foreign to the primitive mind, and the
translations were generally by foreigners who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> had not completely
mastered the idioms. Hence, the only true reflex of a language is in the
words and thoughts of the natives themselves, in their indigenous
literature.</p>

<p>This led me to project the publication of a series of volumes containing
writings, preferably on secular subjects, by natives in their own
languages. That there is such a literature I undertook to show in (<a href="#ref13">13</a>)
and (<a href="#ref14">14</a>). The former was the expansion of a paper presented to the
International Congress of Americanists at Copenhagen. It contains a list
of native American authors and notices of a number of their works
composed in their own tongues. That on “aboriginal poetry” vindicates
for native American bards a respectable position among lyric and
dramatic composers.</p>

<p>That some of the central subjects of poetic literature&mdash;the emotions of
love and friendship&mdash;exist, and often in no low form of sentiment, among
these natives, I have undertaken to show by an analysis of a number of
terms expressing these feelings in five leading American linguistic
stocks, the Algonkin, Nahuatl, Maya, Quechua and Tupi (No. <a href="#ref15">15</a>).</p>

<p>Following out this plan, I began in 1882 the publication of “The Library
of Aboriginal American Literature.” Each volume was to contain a work
composed in a native tongue by a native; but those based upon foreign
inspiration, such as sermons, etc., were to be excluded. Each was to be
translated and edited with sufficient completeness to make it available
for the general student.</p>

<p>Of this “Library” eight volumes were issued, the first in 1882, the
eighth in 1890, when I ceased the publication, not from lack of
material, but because I had retired in 1887 from my connection with the
publishing business and became more engaged in general anthropological
pursuits.</p>

<p>The “Library,” as issued, contains the following numbers:</p>

<p><a name="refI" id="refI"></a>No. I. The Chronicles of the Mayas. Edited by Daniel G. Brinton, M. D.
279 pages. 1882.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hanging">This volume contains five brief chronicles in the Maya language,
written shortly after the conquest, and carrying the history of
that people back many centuries. To these is added a history of
the conquest, written in his native tongue, by a Maya chief, in
1562. This interesting account has been published separately, with
an ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>cellent grammatical and lexical analysis by the Count de
Charencey, under the title <i>Chrestomathie Maya, d’après la
Chronique de Chac-Xulub-Chen</i> (Paris, 1891). The texts are
preceded by an introduction on the history of the Mayas, their
language, calendar, numerical system, etc.; and a vocabulary is
added at the close.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hanging">The original text, written about 1562, by a member of the reigning

<p>The Delaware Indians or Lenni Lenâpé, who occupied the valley of the
Delaware River and the land east of it to the ocean, although long in
peaceful association with the white settlers, were never studied,
linguistically, except by the Moravian missionaries, in the latter half
of the eighteenth century. In examining the MSS. in the Moravian Church
at Bethlehem, Pa., I discovered a MS. dictionary of their tongue,
containing about 4,300 words. This I had carefully copied, and induced a
native Delaware, an educated clergyman of the English Church, the Rev.
Albert Seqaqkind Anthony, to pass a fortnight at my house, going over it
with me, word by word. The MS. thus revised, was published by the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania as the first number of its “Student
Series.” Various interesting items illustrating the beliefs and customs
of the Delawares of the present day, communicated to me by Mr. Anthony,
I collected into the article (<a href="#ref18">18</a>), “Lenâpé Conversations.”</p>

<p>A few years previous I had succeeded in obtaining the singular MS.
referred to by C. S. Rafinesque, in 1836, as the “Painted Record” of the
Delaware Indians, the <i>Walum Olum,</i> properly, “painted” or “red”
“score.” This I reproduced in No. <a href="#ref17">17</a>, with the accessories mentioned
above (p. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>). There is no doubt of the general authenticity of this
record. A corroboration of it was sent me in March of this year (1898)
by Dr. A. S. Gatschet, of the U. S. Bureau of American Ethnology. He
writes:</p>

<p>“When the Delaware delegate, Johnnycake, was here for the last time, he
told Mr. J. B. N. Hewitt (also attached to the Bureau) that some of the
Lenâpé Indians, near Nowata, Cherokee Nation, had seen your publication
on the <i>Walum Olum</i>. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> belong to the oldest men of that tribe, and
stated that the text was all right, and that they remembered the songs
from their youth. They could give many additions, and said that a few
passages were in the wrong order and had to be placed elsewhere to give
them the full meaning they were intended to convey.”</p>

<p>This was cheering confirmation to me that my labor had not been expended
on a fantastic composition of Rafinesque’s, as some have been inclined
to think.</p>

<p>Some years ago I contemplated the publication of a work through the
American Folklore Society on Algonquian Mythology. Various reasons led
me to lay it aside. Part of the material was introduced into my works on
the general mythology of the American tribes,<a name="FNanchor_12-1_6" id="FNanchor_12-1_6" href="#Footnote_12-1_6" class="fnanchor">12-1</a> and one fragment
appeared in (<a href="#ref20">20</a>) in which I offered a psychological explanation of the
character of the hero god Gluscap, so prominent in the legends of the
Micmacs and Abenakis. At that time I was not acquainted with the
ingenious suggestions on the etymology of the name subsequently
advocated by the native author, Joseph Nicolar.<a name="FNanchor_12-2_7" id="FNanchor_12-2_7" href="#Footnote_12-2_7" class="fnanchor">12-2</a></p>

<p>The Nanticokes lived on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay. In
collecting their vocabularies I found one alleged to have been obtained
from them, but differing completely from the Algonquian dialects. It had
been partly printed by Dr. Benjamin Smith Barton,<a name="FNanchor_12-3_8" id="FNanchor_12-3_8" href="#Footnote_12-3_8" class="fnanchor">12-3</a> but remained a
puzzle. My article (<a href="#ref21">21</a>) proves that it belongs to the Mandingo language
of western Africa. It was doubtless obtained from some negro slave.</p>

<p>The Nanticoke vocabulary (<a href="#ref22">22</a>) was secured in 1792 for Mr. Thomas
Jefferson. I give the related terms in the other dialects of the stock.</p>

<p>The Natchez are an interesting people of whose rites we have strange
accounts from the early French explorers. Their language is a small
stock by itself. At one time I thought it related to the Maya (<a href="#ref23">23</a>); but
this is probably an error. In (<a href="#ref24">24</a>) I printed a vocabulary of words
obtained for me from a native, together with some slight grammatical
material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>The Taensas were a branch of the Natchez, speaking the same tongue; but
in 1881, J. Parisot presented an article of half a dozen pages to the
International Congress of Americanists on what he called the “Hastri or
Taensa Language,” totally different from the Natchez.<a name="FNanchor_13-1_9" id="FNanchor_13-1_9" href="#Footnote_13-1_9" class="fnanchor">13-1</a> Subsequently
this was expanded to a volume, and appeared as Tome IX. of the
<i>Bibliothêque Linguistique Américaine</i> (Maisonneuve et Cie, Paris)
introduced by the well-known scholars Lucien Adam and Albert S.
Gatschet.</p>

<p>It passed unchallenged until 1885, when I proved conclusively that the
whole was a forgery of some young seminarists, and had been palmed off
on these unsuspecting scientists out of a pleasure in mystification
(<a href="#ref28">28</a>). As I have given the details elsewhere, I shall not repeat
them.<a name="FNanchor_13-2_10" id="FNanchor_13-2_10" href="#Footnote_13-2_10" class="fnanchor">13-2</a></p>

<p>The works of Pareja in the Timuquana tongue of Florida were unknown to
linguists when, in 1859, I published the little volume (<a href="#ref27">27</a>). In it,
however, I called attention to them, and from the scanty references in
Hervas expressed the opinion that it might be related to the Carib. This
was an error, as no such affinity appears on the fuller examination of
the tongue now possible, since Pareja’s grammar has been
republished,<a name="FNanchor_13-3_11" id="FNanchor_13-3_11" href="#Footnote_13-3_11" class="fnanchor">13-3</a> and texts of the Timuquana have been reproduced by
Buckingham Smith.<a name="FNanchor_13-4_12" id="FNanchor_13-4_12" href="#Footnote_13-4_12" class="fnanchor">13-4</a> The language stands alone, an independent stock.</p>

<p>The <i>Popol Vuh</i>, or “sacred book” of the Quiches of Guatemala was
published by the Abbé Brasseur in 1861. The study (<a href="#ref51">51</a>) is an effort to
analyze the names of the gods which it contains and to extract their
symbolic significance.</p>

<p>The Chane-abal dialect of Chiapas (<a href="#ref52">52</a>) is a mixed jargon, the component
elements of which I have endeavored to set forth from MS. material
collected by Dr. Berendt.</p>

<p>Another language of Chiapas is the “Chapanecan.” In (<a href="#ref57">57</a>) and also in the
introduction to (<a href="#ref45">45</a>) I have shown, from unpublished sources, its close
relationship to the Mangue of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The Mazatec language of Oaxaca, is examined for the first time in (<a href="#ref56">56</a>)
from material supplied me by Mr. A. Pinart. It is shown to have
relations with the Chapanecan and others with Costa Rican tongues.</p>

<p>The article on the Chinantec, (<a href="#ref56">56</a>) a little-known tongue of Oaxaca, is
an analysis of its forms and a vocabulary from the <i>Doctrina</i> of Father
Barreda and notes of Dr. Berendt.</p>

<p>The Cakchiquels occupied most of the soil of Guatemala at the period of
the Conquest, and their tongue was that chosen to be the “Metropolitan”
language of the diocess. In (<a href="#ref53">53</a>) I gave a translation of an unpublished
grammar of it, the MS. being one in the archives of the American
Philosophical Society. In some respects it is superior to the grammar of
Flores.</p>

<p>The higher culture of the tribes of Central America and Mexico gives a
special interest to the study of their languages, oral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> and written; for
with some of them we find moderately well-developed methods of recording
ideas.</p>

<p>Much of this culture was intimately connected with their astrological
methods and these with their calendar. This remarkable artificial
computation of time, based on the relations of the numerals 13 and 20
applied to various periods, was practically the same among the Mayas,
Nahuas, Zapotecs, Mixtecs, Chapanecs, Otomis and Tarascos&mdash;seven
different linguistic stocks&mdash;and unknown elsewhere on the globe. The
study of it (<a href="#ref30">30</a>) is exclusively from its linguistic and symbolic side.</p>

<p>It is strange that nowhere in North America was any measure of weight
known to the natives. Their lineal measures were drawn chiefly from the
proportions of the human body. They are investigated in (<a href="#ref31">31</a>).</p>

<p>Under the names <i>Chontalli</i> and <i>Popoluca</i>, both Nahuatl words
indicating “foreigners,” ethnographers have included tribes of wholly
diverse lineage. In (<a href="#ref32">32</a>) I have shown that some are Tzentals, others
Tequistlatecas, Ulvas, Mixes, Zapotecs, Nahuas, Lencas and Cakchiquels,
thus doing away with the confusion introduced by these inappropriate
ethnic terms.</p>

<p>No. (<a href="#ref33">33</a>) is an article for the use of students of the Nahuatl language,
mentioning the principal grammars, dictionaries and text-books which are
available.</p>

<p>The numbers (<a href="#ref34">34</a>), (<a href="#ref35">35</a>), (<a href="#ref36">36</a>), (<a href="#ref37">37</a>), (<a href="#ref38">38</a>), (<a href="#ref39">39</a>), (<a href="#ref40">40</a>) and (<a href="#ref41">41</a>), are
devoted to the methods of writing invented by the cultured natives of
Mexico and Central America in order to preserve their literature, such
as it was. The methods are various, that of the Nahuas not being
identical with that of the Mayas. The former is largely phonetic, but in
a peculiar manner, for which I have proposed the term of “ikonomatic,”
the principle being that of the rebus. That this method can be
successfully applied to the decipherment of inscriptions I demonstrated
in the translation of one which is quite celebrated, the “Stone of the
Giants” at Orizaba, Mexico (<a href="#ref41">41</a>). The translation I proposed has been
fully accepted.<a name="FNanchor_16-1_13" id="FNanchor_16-1_13" href="#Footnote_16-1_13" class="fnanchor">16-1</a></p>

<p>The “Primer of Mayan Hieroglyphics” (<a href="#ref39">39</a>) was intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> as a summary of
what had been achieved up to that time (1895) by students in this
branch. It endeavored, moreover, to render to each student the credit of
his independent work; and as, unfortunately, some, notably in Germany,
had put forward as their own what belonged to others of earlier date,
the book naturally was not very well treated by such reviewers. Its aim,
however, to present a concise and fair statement of what had been
accomplished in its field up to the date of its publication was
generally conceded to have been attained.</p>

<p>Much of the considerable manuscript material which I have accumulated on
the languages of this section of the continent was obtained from the
collections of the late Dr. Carl Hermann Berendt and the Abbé E. C.
Brasseur (de Bourbourg).</p>

<p>When in Spain, in 1888, I found in the Royal Library the MS. of the
earlier portion of Sahagun’s “History of New Spain” in Nahuatl. I
described it in (<a href="#ref42">42</a>).</p>

<p>The term “Anahuac” has long been applied to the territory of Mexico. Dr.
E. Seler, of Berlin, published an article asserting that this was an
error, and devoid of native authority. In (<a href="#ref43">43</a>) I pointed out that in
this he was wrong, as early Nahuatl records use it in this sense.</p>

<p>The Alaguilac language of Guatemala, long a puzzle to linguistics, is
shown in (<a href="#ref44">44</a>) to be an isolated dialect of the Nahuatl.</p>

<p>Nos. (<a href="#ref45">45</a>), (<a href="#ref46">46</a>), (<a href="#ref47">47</a>), (<a href="#ref49">49</a>) and (<a href="#ref54">54</a>), have been already mentioned.</p>

<p>The term <i>Chilan balam</i>, which may be freely rendered “the inspired
speaker,” was the title of certain priests of the native Mayas. Many
records in the Maya tongue, written after the conquests, go by the name
of “the Books of Chilan Balam.” They have never been published, but
copies of them, made by Dr. Berendt, are in my possession. Their purpose
and contents were described in (<a href="#ref50">50</a>).</p>

<p>There are reasons for believing that previous to the arrival of the
Cakchiquels in Guatemala its area was largely peopled by Xincas. Of this
little-known stock I present in (<a href="#ref58">58</a>) three extended vocabularies, from
unpublished sources, with comments on the “culture-words.”</p>

<p>Some apparent but no decisive affinities between the Otomi of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> Mexico
and the Tinné or Athapascan dialects are shown in (<a href="#ref55">55</a>); and in (<a href="#ref59">59</a>) the
ancient Guetares of Costa Rica are proved, on linguistic evidence, to
have been members of the Talamancan linguistic stock.</p>

<p>The Matagalpan is an interesting family, first defined in <i>The American
Race</i>, and in (<a href="#ref60">60</a>) more fully discussed, as they survive in San
Salvador.</p>

<p>In (<a href="#ref61">61</a>) some unpublished vocabularies from the tribe of the Ramas, on
the Mosquito coast, place them as members of the Changuina stock, most
of whom dwelt on the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p>The library of the American Philosophical Society contains a MS. copy of
the Arawack vocabulary of the missionary Schultz, the same work,
apparently, which was edited from another copy by M. Lucien Adam in
1882. A study of this MS. led me to discover the identity of the
so-called “Lucayan” of the Bahamas, the language of Cuba, fragments of
which have been presented, and the “Taino” of Haiti, with the Arawack.
They had previ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>ously been considered either of Mayan or Caribbean
affinities. The results are presented in (<a href="#ref63">63</a>).</p>

<p>The “Studies” in (<a href="#ref64">64</a>) are ten in number. No. I. is on the Tacana
language and its dialects, and is the only attempt, up to the present
time, to determine the boundaries and character of this tongue. Texts
and a vocabulary in five of its dialects are given. No. II. is on the
Jivaro or Xebero tongue, and is entirely from unpublished sources. A
grammatical sketch, texts and a vocabulary give a moderately complete
material for comparison. No. III. presents the first printed account of
the Cholona language on the River Huallaga, drawn from MSS. in the
British Museum. In No. IV. is a discussion of the relations of the Leca
language spoken on the Rio Mapiri. No. V. contains a text of some length
in the Manao dialect of the Arawack stock, the original MS. being in the
British Museum. The Bonaris are an extinct tribe of the Carib stock. No.
VI. contains the only vocabulary which has been preserved of their
dialect. On a loose sheet in the British Museum, among papers on
Patagonia, I found a short vocabulary in a tongue called “Hongote,”
which I could not locate and hence published it in No. VII. It
subsequently proved to be one of the North Pacific Coast languages. The
same “Study” presents a comparative vocabulary in fourteen Patagonian
dialects, with notes (Tsoneca, Tehuelche, Puelche, Tekennika (Yahgan),
Alikuluf, etc.). In Study No. VIII. are discussed the various dialects
of the Kechua or Quichua tongue of Peru, with an unpublished text from
the Pacasa dialect. No. IX. examines the affinities which have been
noted between the languages of North and South America, especially in
the Mazatec and Costa Rican dialects of the northern Continent. Finally,
No. X. aims to define for the first time the linguistic stock to which
belong the dialects of the Betoyas, Tucanos, Zeonas and other tribes on
the rivers Napo, Meta, Apure and their confluents. Further information
on this stock is given in (<a href="#ref68">68</a>).</p>

<p>The Choco stock extends widely over the northwest angle of the southern
continent. In (<a href="#ref65">65</a>) and (<a href="#ref66">66</a>) I have printed short vocabularies of some of
its dialects secured for me from living natives by Mr. Henry G.
Granger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>The Puquina language of Peru was quite unknown to linguists when, in
1890, I published the article (<a href="#ref67">67</a>) containing material in it from the
extremely rare work of Geronimo de Ore, entitled <i>Rituale Peruanum</i>
(Naples, 1607). Since then an extended essay upon it has been written by
M. de la Grasserie.</p>

<p>In the “Further Notes on the Fuegian Languages” (<a href="#ref70">70</a>), I have printed an
Alikuluf vocabulary of 1695, with comparisons, and given a vocabulary of
the idiom of the Onas, pointing out some affinities with the Yahgan.</p>

<p>Few linguistic areas on the continent have been more obscure than that
called “El Gran Chaco,” in northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. In
(<a href="#ref69">69</a>) I have mapped the area from 20° to 30° south latitude and 56° to
66° west longitude, defining the boundaries of each of the seven
linguistic stocks which occupied it, to wit, the Ennima, Guaycuru, Lule,
Mataco, Quechua, Samucu and Tupi, with discussions of some uncertain
dialects, as the Calchaqui, Lengua, Querandi, Charua, Payagua.</p>

<p>In (<a href="#ref70">70</a>) recent vocabularies of the Andoa and Cataquina tongues are
examined and their linguistic relations discussed.</p>

<p>Many of the above articles, written previous to 1890, were collected by
me in that year and published in a volume entitled “Essays of an
Americanist” (pp. 489. Philadelphia). For the convenience of those who
may wish to refer to them I add here a complete list of the essays which
it contains.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
